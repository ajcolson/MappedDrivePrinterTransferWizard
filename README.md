# MappedDrivePrinterTransferWizard
 A tiny hacked together tool for moving user mapped drives and printers during a machine migration.

# Notes
## What is this?
 This is a port of a project I created in 2018 to assist technicians with workstation migrations for end users. The application assumes a user with local workstation admin rights will run it.
## How does it work?
 Technicians would run this app to backup data from an old workstation and migrate it to a new one. The app itself runs a builtin script and generates two files to pass between workstations.
## Aren't there other/better ways to accomplish this?
  Yes.
